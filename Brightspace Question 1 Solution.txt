Brightspace Question 1 Solution
This walkthrough details the solution to Brightspace Question 1, utilizing the functions implemented in assignment 3.py (
bayesFunction
 and 
bayesFactor
).

A. Posterior Probability
Question: Calculate the posterior value that people can see in the future under the data.

Explanation: We use the 
bayesFunction(p_h, p_d_given_h, p_d_given_not_h)
 to calculate the posterior probability P(H|D).

Prior (P(H)): 0.5 (Given: "equal to not seeing in the future")
Likelihood (P(D|H)): 0.531 (Given: probability to observe data under hypothesis H)
Likelihood (P(D|!H)): 0.52 (Given: probability to observe data under hypothesis !H)
The function applies Bayes' theorem: P(H|D) = (P(D|H) * P(H)) / (P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|!H) * (1 - P(H)))

Calculation: P(H|D) = (0.531 * 0.5) / (0.531 * 0.5 + 0.52 * 0.5) P(H|D) approx. 0.5052

Answer: 0.5052

B. Bayes Factor
Question: What is the Bayes factor? (BF H, !H)

Explanation: We use the 
bayesFactor(posteriors, priors)
 function. The Bayes Factor quantifies the support for one hypothesis over another provided by the data, independent of the priors.

Posteriors: [0.5052, 1 - 0.5052] (Calculated in A)
Priors: [0.5, 0.5]
The function calculates the ratio of posterior odds to prior odds: BF_1_not_1 = Posterior Odds / Prior Odds = (P(H|D) / P(!H|D)) / (P(H) / P(!H))

Alternatively, it is simply the ratio of likelihoods: BF = P(D|H) / P(D|!H)

Calculation: BF = 0.531 / 0.52 BF approx. 1.0212

Answer: 1.0212

C. Skeptic Researcher
Question: Eric-Jan, a more skeptic researcher, thinks the prior probability that people can look into the future is 0.001. What are the posterior odds for such a skeptic researcher?

Explanation: We can use the Bayes Factor calculated in B to update the skeptic's prior odds. This demonstrates the utility of the Bayes Factor: it can be applied to any prior.

Skeptic's Prior (P(H)): 0.001
Skeptic's Prior Odds: 0.001 / 0.999 approx. 0.001001
Calculation: Posterior Odds = Bayes Factor * Prior Odds Posterior Odds approx. 1.0212 * 0.001001 Posterior Odds approx. 0.001022

Alternatively, calculating the posterior probability directly using 
bayesFunction
 with the new prior yields approx. 0.001021, which corresponds to the same odds.

Answer: 0.001022

D. Replicated Experiments
Question: For each experiment give the new posteriors of P(H_people_see_in_the_future | Data).

Explanation: Bayesian inference allows for sequential updating. The posterior from one experiment becomes the prior for the next. We use 
bayesFunction
 iteratively.

Experiment 1 (Initial):

Posterior: 0.5052 (from A)
Experiment 2:

Prior: 0.5052 (Posterior from Exp 1)
Likelihoods: P(D|H)=0.471, P(D|!H)=0.520
Update: 
bayesFunction(0.5052, 0.471, 0.520)
New Posterior: 0.4805
Experiment 3:

Prior: 0.4805 (Posterior from Exp 2)
Likelihoods: P(D|H)=0.491, P(D|!H)=0.65
Update: 
bayesFunction(0.4805, 0.491, 0.65)
New Posterior: 0.4113
Experiment 4:

Prior: 0.4113 (Posterior from Exp 3)
Likelihoods: P(D|H)=0.505, P(D|!H)=0.70
Update: 
bayesFunction(0.4113, 0.505, 0.70)
New Posterior: 0.3351
Answer:

Experiment 2 Posterior: 0.4805
Experiment 3 Posterior: 0.4113
Experiment 4 Posterior: 0.3351
E. Argument
Question: Using the Bayes Factor, argue briefly whether the data convinces that people can look into the future.

Explanation: We calculate the cumulative Bayes Factor by multiplying the Bayes Factors from each individual experiment.

BF1 approx. 1.02
BF2 = 0.471 / 0.520 approx. 0.91
BF3 = 0.491 / 0.65 approx. 0.76
BF4 = 0.505 / 0.70 approx. 0.72
Calculation: BF_total = BF1 * BF2 * BF3 * BF4 BF_total approx. 0.504

Argument: The total Bayes Factor is approximately 0.504. This means that the observed data is about twice as likely (1 / 0.504 approx. 1.98) to occur under the null hypothesis (people cannot see into the future) than under the alternative hypothesis. A Bayes Factor < 1 indicates evidence for the null hypothesis. Therefore, the data does not convince that people can look into the future. Instead, it provides weak/anecdotal evidence against the claim.
