Brightspace Question 3 Solution
This document provides the answers for Brightspace Question 3 regarding the comparison of the Relative Frequency (RF) and Bayesian Sampling (BS) models based on their Total BIC scores.

A. Total BIC Scores
The Total BIC scores (summed over all 84 participants) are:

Model	Total BIC Score
(i) RF Model (Relative Frequency)	5558.05
(ii) BS Model (Bayesian Sampling)	3369.30
(Values are rounded to 2 decimal places)

B. Model Preference and Explanation
Preferred Model: Bayesian Sampling (BS)

Explanation: The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a metric used for model selection that balances the quality of the model's fit (MSE) against its complexity (number of parameters). A lower BIC score indicates a better model.

The RF Model has a total BIC of 5558.05.
The BS Model has a total BIC of 3369.30.
The BS model has a significantly lower BIC score compared to the RF model. This means that even after penalizing for its slightly higher complexity (7 effective parameters vs. 6 for RF), the BS model provides a much better description of the human data. The improvement in fit (lower MSE) outweighs the penalty for the extra parameter, making it the superior model for this dataset.

Methodological Summary
Data Processing: Code was modified to iterate through all 84 participant files located in the Experiment 2 folder.
BIC Calculation:
Formula used: BIC = n * log(MSE) + log(n) * (parameters + 1) + n * log(2*pi) + n
Where n = 120 (40 queries x 3 repetitions).
RF Model Parameters: 6
BS Model Parameters: 7
Aggregation: The BIC score was calculated for each participant individually and then summed to produce the Total BIC reported above.
